Requirements: cooperative and inclusive

Approach: 
1. [X] Extract some principles from Buddhism to json

2. [ ] Generate scenarios for fine-tuning a model using the above principles. Create a DPO-style dataset with both positive and negative responses. 

3. [ ] SFT a model over the cooperative dataset. 

4. [ ] Design a metric to measure cooperation. Evaluate dataset based on metric.
